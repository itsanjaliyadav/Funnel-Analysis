Project Summary: Swiggy Funnel Analysis

In this project, I conducted a thorough analysis of the company's performance for the year 2019. The aim was to unearth key insights into Swiggy's operations and identify opportunities for improvement using data from the 'Funnel Case Study Data' workbook, consisting of three essential worksheets.

Key Tasks and Achievements:

Order Fluctuations: I determined fluctuations in the number of daily orders, filling in the remaining columns in the 'Session Details' worksheet as required. I also identified notable dates with order highs and lows in comparison to the same day the previous week, offering valuable insights into customer behaviour.

Traffic Analysis: I scrutinized changes in web traffic compared to the previous week, investigating any potential shifts in traffic sources using the 'Channel Wise Traffic' sheet. This helped in understanding the driving factors behind changes in user engagement.

Conversion Analysis: By examining overall conversion rates and breaking them down into smaller components (L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O), I identified which specific conversions exhibited fluctuations. I then formulated hypotheses to explain these fluctuations, considering how various factors influenced user behaviour.

Hypothesis Validation: To validate the hypotheses, I drew from data available in the 'Supporting Data' sheet, providing a deeper understanding of the root causes behind conversion rate fluctuations.

My assignment submission consisted of a comprehensive Funnel Analysis Report, which not only presented findings and insights but also offered explanations for order fluctuations, variations in web traffic, and changes in conversion rates.
