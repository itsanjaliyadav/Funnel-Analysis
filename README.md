Project Summary:

In this project, I created an advanced Excel dashboard for a leading food e-commerce company's analytics team. The goal was to assist business stakeholders in making data-driven decisions by providing them with a comprehensive and interactive view of the company's performance.

I meticulously collated data at the order_id level and utilised calculated fields to derive key business metrics such as Average Order Value (AOV), Discount Percentage, Average Rating, and Average Delivery Time. These metrics were critical in assessing and presenting the company's performance.

The Excel workbook comprises four distinct sheets, all interconnected through slicers for easy city and restaurant selection. The sheets are structured as follows:

Overall Numbers: This sheet presents a high-level overview of the company's performance, offering insights into revenue trends, order counts, and the impact of discounts. Month-wise revenue and order tables, along with visual representations of city and restaurant-wise orders, were included.

City-wise Dashboard: Focusing on city-specific insights, this sheet displays revenue and order trends, average delivery times, discount percentages, and restaurant ratings for each city.

Restaurant-wise Dashboard: Here, we delve into restaurant-specific performance, showcasing revenue and order trends, average delivery times, discount percentages, and restaurant ratings for each individual restaurant.

Report to Manager: This final sheet is dedicated to summarising findings and insights obtained from the graphs. It provides a concise narrative of the data, enabling the management team to make informed decisions.

By creating this sophisticated dashboard, I have equipped our business stakeholders with a powerful tool that empowers them to understand the company's performance at a glance and make data-driven decisions more effectively.
